ABOUT ME
</h1>	

<div>
<p align="left">
Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Paige, a final-year software engineering student from the University of British Columbia. Since 2020, I have gained hands-on experience in software development from internships and developing custom projects in hackathons and on my own time.<br><br>
Through these experiences and my university courses, I have developed the following skills:<br>
â€¢ <b>Programming Languages:</b> JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C++, Java, and Ruby on Rails<br>
â€¢ <b>Front-End:</b> HTML, CSS, React.js, and Next.js<br>
â€¢ <b>Back-End:</b> Node.js, Express.js, Oracle, MySQL and REST APIs<br>
Furthermore, I am a GIRLSmarts4Tech Workshop Facilitator, which allows me to support and inspire young girls to learn to code. I have also spent 3 years as an executive member of UBC's largest business and technology club, UBC BizTech. During my time as President, I led several events including hackathons, conferences, networking events, and a mentorship program to provide exposure to the tech industry for students at UBC.
